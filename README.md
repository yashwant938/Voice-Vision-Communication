voice vision communication using python
Introduction: The field of computer vision and natural language processing has been rapidly advancing, and the task of image captioning has gained a lot of attention in recent years. The ability to generate natural language descriptions of images has many applications, including assistive technology for the visually impaired, content-based image retrieval, and video surveillance.
In this research paper, we present a system that generates captions for images and retrieves images based on user inputted captions. The system uses InceptionV3 and LSTM networks to extract features from images and generate captions. Additionally, we also implement an image retrieval system that returns the most similar images based on the user inputted caption.
InceptionV3 and LSTM Networks: The InceptionV3 network is a pre-trained deep neural network that was originally designed for image classification. However, we can also use it to extract features from images, which can be used to generate captions. We remove the last layer of the InceptionV3 network and use the output from the second last layer as the feature vector for the image. We then pass the feature vector through a dense layer and a dropout layer before passing it to the LSTM network.
The LSTM network takes the feature vector from the image and a sequence of words as inputs and generates the next word in the sequence as output. We use an embedding layer to convert the numerical representation of the words to a dense vector representation before passing it through the LSTM network. The LSTM network is trained using the captions for the images in the dataset.
Caption Generation: To generate captions for the images, we use a vocabulary to convert the text to numerical form, which is used by the LSTM network to generate captions. We begin by loading the descriptions of the images from a text file and creating a vocabulary for the captions.
We then preprocess the images using the InceptionV3 network and pass the feature vector through the dense and dropout layers. We then feed the feature vector and the start token to the LSTM network to generate the first word in the caption sequence. We then feed the feature vector and the first word to the LSTM network to generate the second word in the sequence, and so on, until the end token is generated.
Image Retrieval: To implement the image retrieval system, we first encode the inputted caption using the same vocabulary used for generating captions. We then calculate the cosine similarity between the encoded caption and the captions for each image in the dataset. The images with the highest similarity score are returned as the most similar images.
Evaluation: We test the system using a dataset of images and corresponding captions. We randomly select 80% of the dataset for training the LSTM network and the remaining 20% for testing. We train the LSTM network for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
We evaluate the system using the BLEU score, which measures the similarity between the generated caption and the ground truth caption. We achieve a BLEU-1 score of 0.76 and a BLEU-4 score of 0.31, indicating that the system generates captions that are relevant to the images.
